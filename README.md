# Tools

Welcome to my personal **tools** repository! This is just a collection of some scripts, tools, and modules I've built to make data science tasks easier and faster, such as Python utilities for things like cleaning data, running machine learning, visualizing results, and automating workflows.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/datdatasciguy/tools.git
```

## Contribute

Feel free to open issues or pull requests if you have ideas or tools to share!
